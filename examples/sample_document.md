# Cognitive Document Reader Example

## Introduction

This is a sample document to demonstrate the cognitive document reader's capabilities.

### Purpose

The cognitive document reader processes documents using:

- **Progressive reading**: Processes content sequentially
- **Hierarchical synthesis**: Builds understanding from sections to whole
- **Multi-language support**: English and Spanish

## Key Features

### 1. Document Processing

The system can handle various document types and extract meaningful information.

### 2. Language Detection

Automatic detection of document language for appropriate processing.

### 3. Structured Output

Generates both JSON (for integration) and Markdown (for humans) outputs.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Parser**: Extracts document structure
2. **Reader**: Processes content progressively  
3. **Synthesizer**: Builds hierarchical understanding
4. **LLM Client**: Manages language model interactions

### Processing Flow

The document processing follows these steps:

1. Parse document structure
2. Detect language and hierarchy
3. Read sections progressively
4. Synthesize complete understanding

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how the cognitive document reader can process and understand documents in a human-like manner, providing both detailed analysis and structured outputs for various use cases.
